# Product Requirements Document: User Feedback for Successful Sign-up

## Introduction/Overview

This feature enhances the user experience during account registration by providing clear, informative feedback when a user successfully signs up for the coaching platform. The current implementation provides basic toast notifications, but users need more comprehensive guidance about what happens next and how to proceed with their fitness journey.

**Problem**: Users currently receive minimal feedback after successful account creation, leading to potential confusion about next steps and requiring support interventions.

**Goal**: Implement enhanced user feedback that confirms successful account creation and provides clear guidance for immediate next steps.

## Goals

1. **Reduce User Confusion**: Eliminate uncertainty about whether account creation was successful
2. **Improve User Experience**: Provide a smooth transition from registration to subscription selection
3. **Reduce Support Tickets**: Minimize support requests related to account creation status and next steps
4. **Increase Conversion**: Guide users seamlessly to subscription selection with clear value proposition
5. **Build User Confidence**: Establish trust through professional, informative feedback

## User Stories

**User Story 1**: Account Creation Confirmation
- **As a** new user who just completed the sign-up form
- **I want to** receive immediate confirmation that my account was created successfully
- **So that** I know the registration process worked and I can proceed with confidence

**User Story 2**: Next Steps Guidance
- **As a** newly registered user
- **I want to** understand what I need to do next to start using the platform
- **So that** I can quickly access workouts and begin my fitness journey

**User Story 3**: Subscription Context
- **As a** new user who just created an account
- **I want to** understand why I need to choose a subscription
- **So that** I'm motivated to complete the onboarding process rather than abandon it

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Success Toast Notification Enhancement
- **R1.1**: Display primary success message "Account created successfully! Welcome to the coaching platform."
- **R1.2**: Include user's name in the welcome message when available
- **R1.3**: Use appropriate success styling (green checkmark icon, positive color scheme)
- **R1.4**: Display toast for minimum 4 seconds to ensure readability

### 2. Next Steps Guidance Toast
- **R2.1**: Display secondary informational toast with next steps guidance
- **R2.2**: Message should read: "Next: Choose a subscription plan to access personalized workouts and coaching"
- **R2.3**: Include visual indication of progression (e.g., step indicator: "Step 2 of 3")
- **R2.4**: Display guidance toast for 6 seconds to allow full reading

### 3. Automatic Redirection
- **R3.1**: Automatically redirect user to `/athlete/subscription` after 2-second delay
- **R3.2**: Ensure redirection happens after both toast messages are displayed
- **R3.3**: Maintain existing router navigation functionality

### 4. Error Handling
- **R4.1**: Maintain existing error toast functionality for failed registrations
- **R4.2**: Ensure success feedback only displays when database user creation is confirmed
- **R4.3**: Handle edge cases where redirection might fail

### 5. Accessibility Requirements
- **R5.1**: Ensure toast notifications are screen reader accessible
- **R5.2**: Provide sufficient color contrast for visually impaired users
- **R5.3**: Include proper ARIA labels for toast content

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Email Confirmation Integration**: This feature will not modify the email verification workflow
2. **Welcome Email**: No automated welcome email will be sent as part of this feature
3. **Onboarding Modal**: Will not implement a full-screen onboarding modal or wizard
4. **Profile Completion Prompts**: Will not add profile completion guidance at this stage
5. **Social Media Integration**: No social sharing of account creation
6. **Analytics Tracking**: User registration analytics are outside this feature's scope

## Design Considerations

### Toast Styling
- Use existing Sonner toast library styling for consistency
- Leverage success variant with green accent colors
- Include checkmark or success icon for visual confirmation
- Ensure mobile responsiveness for toast notifications

### User Experience Flow
1. User submits registration form
2. Form validation passes and submission begins
3. Database user creation completes successfully
4. Primary success toast appears immediately
5. Secondary guidance toast appears 1 second later
6. Automatic redirection occurs after 2 seconds
7. User arrives at subscription page with context

### Component Integration
- Build on existing `useAction` hook implementation in sign-up page
- Utilize current Sonner toast system without breaking changes
- Maintain existing form validation and error handling patterns

## Technical Considerations

### Current Implementation Analysis
- **Toast Library**: Sonner is already implemented and functional
- **Navigation**: Next.js router with `useRouter` hook is in use
- **State Management**: Form state managed by react-hook-form with next-safe-action
- **Success Handling**: Current `onSuccess` callback in `useAction` hook

### Integration Points
- **File**: `/src/app/(auth)/sign-up/page.tsx` (lines 28-40)
- **Action**: `/src/actions/auth-actions.ts` - `signUpAction` returns success data
- **Dependencies**: No new dependencies required
- **Database**: No schema changes needed

### Implementation Approach
1. Enhance the `onSuccess` callback to include user name in success message
2. Add sequential toast notifications with appropriate timing
3. Implement delayed redirection using `setTimeout`
4. Ensure proper cleanup of timeouts if component unmounts

### Performance Considerations
- Use `setTimeout` for redirection delay (no additional dependencies)
- Leverage existing toast queuing system in Sonner
- Ensure no memory leaks with proper timeout cleanup

## Success Metrics

### User Experience Metrics
- **Reduced Support Tickets**: 40% decrease in account creation related support requests
- **Improved User Flow**: 90% of users who see success feedback proceed to subscription page
- **User Satisfaction**: Positive feedback about registration clarity in user surveys

### Technical Metrics
- **Zero Breaking Changes**: No regression in existing registration functionality
- **Fast Implementation**: Feature completed without introducing new dependencies
- **Accessibility Compliance**: All toast notifications pass accessibility audits

### Business Metrics
- **Increased Subscription Conversions**: 15% improvement in registration-to-subscription conversion rate
- **Reduced Drop-off**: Decreased user abandonment between registration and subscription selection

## Open Questions

1. **Toast Timing**: Should we adjust the 4-6 second display times based on user testing?
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Should we add a fallback for users with JavaScript disabled?
3. **Mobile Optimization**: Do we need different toast timing or positioning for mobile devices?
4. **Internationalization**: Will this feature need to support multiple languages in the future?
5. **A/B Testing**: Should we implement analytics to test different message variations?
