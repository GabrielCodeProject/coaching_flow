# Task List: Sign-up Feedback Enhancement

## Relevant Files

- `src/app/(auth)/sign-up/page.tsx` - Main sign-up component containing the form and success handling logic that needs to be enhanced.
- `src/app/(auth)/sign-up/page.test.tsx` - Unit tests for the sign-up page component.
- `src/actions/auth-actions.ts` - Contains the signUpAction that returns user data needed for personalized success messages.
- `src/actions/auth-actions.test.ts` - Unit tests for auth actions.
- `src/components/ui/sonner.tsx` - Toast component configuration that may need accessibility enhancements.

### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `page.tsx` and `page.test.tsx` in the same directory).
- Use `npx jest [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the Jest configuration.
